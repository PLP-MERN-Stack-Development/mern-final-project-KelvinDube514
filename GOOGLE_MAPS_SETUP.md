## Setup Instructions

### 1. Google Maps API Key Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Directions API
   - Geocoding API
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Restrict the API key to your domain for security

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```env
# Google Maps API Key
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here

# Backend API URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Socket.io Server URL
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The required dependencies are already installed:
- `@googlemaps/react-wrapper`
- `@googlemaps/js-api-loader`

### 4. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with your Google Maps API key:

```env
# Google Maps API Configuration
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here

# Backend API Configuration  
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Development Settings
VITE_APP_ENV=development
VITE_DEBUG_MAPS=false
```

### 5. Start the Application

```bash
